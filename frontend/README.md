# ðŸ’» Sections Insight

## Project Overview
Sections Insight is a frontend application that allows users to manage and gain insights into course section data at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The application enables users to add, remove, and view course section datasets, as well as access visual insights into the data.

## Video Walkthrough
Note, volume might be low, apologies for that - I don't have a good mic. I think using headphones would help.

## Installation and Setup

To run our project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC310-2023W-T2/project_team106.git
```

2. Open up the folder in your code editor (VS Code) and run:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

3. In a separate terminal navigate to the frontend folder:
```
cd project_team106/frontend
```

4. Install dependencies & start the server:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This should automatically open the application in your default web browser. If not, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.


## What We Learned

Through this project, our team improved our understandings of:

- Software engineering best practices, such as version control, code organization, and team collaboration.
- Working with an API and translating it into a user interface.
- Understanding the needs of user through the development of a real-world application.
